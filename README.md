# Flickering Lights Shader (URP ShaderGraph)

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/dkLUQ6XJVS0) you will learn how to create 3 different flickering emissive effects using ShaderGraph.
While this is using Christmas lights as an example, this has wide ranging applicability within games such as flickering horror lights, emissive sci-fi materials, and more.
